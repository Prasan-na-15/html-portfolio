<hr />
<h3>Shawshank redemption</h3>
<p>One of the movies which gave meaning to the word redemption.....Showcasing the life of a victim who had to go through a hard time in jail.</p>
<h3>Avengers:End game</h3>
<p>Really cool sci-fi movie involving dynamic scenes and setups to showcase the fight between two biggest forces in the universe.</p>
<h3>The pursuit of happiness</h3>
<p>Great example that shows "Nothing can stop you from achieving unless its your own self"......Shows the Good,Bad and Ugly sides of life in a single movie</p>
